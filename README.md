# MusicLib

This is a master-detail application that display a list of movies obtained from a iTunes Search API and 
show a detailed view of each item

## Installation

Clone my repository and import it to your Android Studio IDE.
Build the source code and generate APK file or if you have android device connected, 
just press run and wait the app to be installed in your device.
The app supports Android 4.3 (Jellybean) to Android 9 (Pie).

## About the App
MVP framework architecture was used to build the app from scratch. 
For persistence, I used shared preference and GSON Library to save JSON data
if data connection is not present 
For UI, it is just a simple Material design to display data and for minimalism
